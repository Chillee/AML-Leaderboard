# Aragon Math League Leaderboard
A web application for processing the scores from the Aragon Math League. Provides a more efficient way to enter scores as compared the a standard spreadsheet application. Also provides a web interface for students, teachers, and organizers to view performance.

The Aragon Math League is an annual multi-round middle school competition for local schools. The Math League serves as preparation for the annual Aragon Mathematics Competition, which is held in the Spring time at Aragon High School. The contests are prepared and organized by the Aragon Mathematics Club. This project was also developed by the club in collaboration with the Aragon Programming Club.
